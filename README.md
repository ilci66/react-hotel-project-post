# React Hotel Project
## npx create react project
*   create the project folder and run npm run start to test if it works

*   Get bunch of pics that you will use from unsplash or somthing (view, rooms, spa, gym etc.) and save them inside the public/assets in the root of your project

*   Add tailwind css

*   Clear everything inside the app.js file and start creating yours, we will create a functional component

*   As we wont be needing built-in App.js files we can delete the app.css file as well. We will use the App.js file to handle the routing

*   give body a flex and flex column also set the basics such as margin:0 padding:0 ext. box-sizing: border-box

*   Rest of our css will be handled with tailwind and will be inline, if you don't like handling styling this way you can go ahead and include your own method. 

*   Create the navbar for our app. Firs create a folder inside the src folder called components and create the navbar compoentn here. 

* For our pages I created a pages folder in src folder. These files i create here will serve as my pages. 

## Installing the router

* "npm install react-router-dom" install the react router. 
* We will be creating 4 files in our pages folder. home.jsx, rooms.jsx, facilities.jsx, contact.jsx
